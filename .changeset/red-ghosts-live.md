Add fetch failure recovery mechanism

_NOTE_: The `usePerformanceUrl` hook api has changed so that the function now takes a single parameter that includes the `origin` param.
This would usually be a major version bump but given the age of the package this is only going to be a minor version bump.
API changes like this in the future will be major version bumps.
